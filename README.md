This repo contains my solution to a one-day challenge set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen during week three of Makers Academy

Task
----

* Imagine you're writing software to control the flow of planes at an airport:
	- The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. 
	- Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 
	- planes must go to the runway before taking off
	- a plane must have permission from the air traffic controller before taking off
	- there can be a bomb scare at the airport, in which case no plane can take-off/land
	- the bomb scare can be called off, in which case everything goes back to normal
	- planes must have a crew (a pilot and stewards/sewardesses)
